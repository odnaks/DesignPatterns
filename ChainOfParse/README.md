# Design pattern: Chain of responsibility
```
Task:

You need to write a chain of parsers that will try to parse the response from the server into an array of objects.
Each parser can work with its own data structure. 
You need write a function,
which takes a file name as input and returns an array of [Person].
And this function should work for any of the three files.

```
